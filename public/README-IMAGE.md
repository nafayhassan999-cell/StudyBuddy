# Product Image Placeholder

## 📸 Add Your Product Screenshot Here

This folder is where you should place your product screenshot/image.

### Image Requirements:
- **Filename**: `product-screenshot.png` (or update the filename in `app/page.tsx`)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (e.g., 1920x1080px, 1280x720px, 3840x2160px)
- **Format**: PNG, JPG, or WebP
- **Recommended Size**: 1920x1080px for optimal quality
- **Max File Size**: Keep under 2MB for fast loading

### How to Add Your Image:

1. **Take a Screenshot** of your StudyBuddy dashboard or key feature
2. **Save it** with the name `product-screenshot.png`
3. **Place it** in the `public` folder (same location as this file)
4. **Refresh** your landing page to see it!

### Alternative:
If you want to use a different filename:
1. Save your image in the `public` folder with any name
2. Update the path in `app/page.tsx` line ~184:
   ```tsx
   src="/your-image-name.png"
   ```

### Temporary Placeholder:
Until you add your actual image, the page will show a gradient placeholder. The layout is already optimized for 16:9 ratio images!
